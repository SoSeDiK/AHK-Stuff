## Scripts
Some scripts might seem useless, but they may be bound to the macro keys (if present) on the keyboard to serve as quick actions. That's what I do.

- [Always On Top](Scripts/Always%20On%20Top.ahk) — Making the active window always on top of other windows.
- [Google Search](Scripts/Google%20Search.ahk) — Search Google the highlighted text. You may also quickly search in images or maps.
- [MMB To Move Up](Scripts/MMB%20To%20Move%20Up.ahk) — Use `Middle Mouse Button` to move one folder up in Explorer.
- [Minimize On Title Middle Mouse Button Click](Scripts/Minimize%20On%20Title%20Middle%20Mouse%20Button%20Click.ahk) — Minimize window upon pressing `Middle Mouse Button` on title bar.
- [Minimize Window](Scripts/Minimize%20Window.ahk) — Quickly minimize the active window.
- [Open With WinRAR](Scripts/Open%20With%20WinRAR.ahk) — Open `.jar` or `.apk` files in WinRAR via `LMB` + `RMB`.
- [Plain CopyPaster](Scripts/Plain%20CopyPaster.ahk) — Copy/Cut/Paste the Clipboard as a plain text (by `Win` + `C`/`X`/`V`).
- [PrintScreen Stupidity Fix](Scripts/PrintScreen%20Stupidity%20Fix.ahk) — Open `Snip & Sketch` via the default hotkey, because binding it to `PrintScreen` does not work in some cases like when playing games.

## Utils
Scripts that are not "functional" by themselves, but rather provide some one-time actions when executed.

- [Kill AHK](Utils/Kill%20AHK.ahk) — Kill all running AHK scripts.
- [Open In Explorer](Utils/Open%20In%20Explorer.ahk) — Open the provided file in Explorer and highlight it.
  - Use-case: when sending files from Android to Windows via Join, so you can navigate to the file instead of opening it.
